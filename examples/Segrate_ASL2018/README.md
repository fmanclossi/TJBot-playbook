# Segrate Alternanza Scuola Lavoro May 2018

This page collects TJBot activities performed with high-school students at IBM Segrate HQ in May, 2018.

We worked with four TJBot already configured as described in [setup pages](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/setup).

There was also a custom TJBot to demonstrate advanced behavior.

Students worked in team up to 4 members with a dedicated TJBot. Smaller groups are better, of course.
