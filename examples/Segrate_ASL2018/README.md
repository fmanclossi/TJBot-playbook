# Segrate Alternanza Scuola Lavoro May 2018

This page collects TJBot activities performed with high-school students at IBM Segrate HQ in May, 2018.

We worked with four TJBot already configured as described in [setup pages](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/setup).

Students worked in team up to 4 members with a dedicated TJBot. Smaller groups are better, of course.

## Step 1 - Introduce TJBot

**Do you like TJBot?** So, there will be no problem to explain our preferred robot :)

We used a single chart from main presentation:

In addition, we had an enhanced TJBot to show how much is easy to expand it.
