# Segrate Alternanza Scuola Lavoro May 2018

This page collects TJBot activities performed with high-school students at IBM Segrate HQ in May, 2018.

Work with four TJBot already configured as described in [setup pages](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/setup).

## Setup requirements:

* Copy [actions](Images/actions) folder to [TJbot http public path.](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/setup/Setup_Node-Red_on_TJBot.md#setup-node-red-on-tjbot)

* Copy [HTML_files](HTML_files) on students laptop.

* add a sticker to each TJBot with its own IP ADDRESS.

Students work in team up to 4 members with a dedicated TJBot. Smaller groups are better, of course.

## Step 1 - Introduce TJBot

**Do you like TJBot?** So, there will be no problem to explain our preferred robot :)

Use a single chart from main presentation:

In addition, you can use an enhanced TJBot to show how much is easy to expand it.

## Step 2 - Introduce Node-Red

### Node-Red Flow Editor

Guide students to connect to Node-Red flow editor pointing available browser to http:<<TJBot_ip_address>>:1880

### Explain Node-Red

Node-RED is a flow-based development tool developed by Nick O’Leary and Dave Conway-Jones of IBM’s Emerging Technology Services group for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services as part of the Internet of Things. Node-RED coding is performed by a browser-based flow editor.

Then show that Node-Red is just connect nodes with tubes. Nodes can be used to input info in tubes, extract info from them or elaborate data that pass through the pipe.

### Guide the student to create a simple wire using INJECT and DEBUG nodes.

## Step 3 - Introduce TJBot Node-Red nodes

### Guide students to TJBot nodes

Ask to insert TJ in "filter nodes" search box (left high corner of Node-Red Flow Editor) to quickly find TJBot nodes and introduce them (you can also use a slide).

### Let's create a simple TJBot flow

Suggest to use INJECT and WAVE nodes to program the most simple TJBot example.

*.... to be completed...*

Challenge team to create a flow that raise arm and turn BLUE the LED. (so, you can explain TJBot LED and SHINE node).

*.... to be completed...*

Ask to Turn LED on RED, then wave arm and finally turn off the LED.

Open Question: Why I can see RED light?

Introduce SLEEP node and ask to modify the flow in order to have RED light available for 2 seconds.

*.... to be completed...*

(if you have time, let the students free to create their own TJBot movement.

### Create a web site powered by TJBot
