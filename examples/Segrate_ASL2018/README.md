# Segrate Alternanza Scuola Lavoro May 2018

This page collects TJBot activities performed with high-school students at IBM Segrate HQ in May, 2018.

Work with four TJBot already configured as described in [setup pages](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/setup).

Students work in team up to 4 members with a dedicated TJBot. Smaller groups are better, of course.

## Step 1 - Introduce TJBot

**Do you like TJBot?** So, there will be no problem to explain our preferred robot :)

Use a single chart from main presentation:

In addition, you can use an enhanced TJBot to show how much is easy to expand it.

## Step 2 - Introduce Node-Red

* Guide the students to connect to Node-Red flow editor pointing browser to http:<<TJBot_ip_address>>:1880

* Explain Node-Red

Node-RED is a flow-based development tool developed by Nick O’Leary and Dave Conway-Jones of IBM’s Emerging Technology Services group for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services as part of the Internet of Things. Node-RED coding is performed by a browser-based flow editor.

Then show that Node-Red is just connect nodes with tubes. Nodes can be used to input info in tubes, extract info from them or elaborate data that pass through the pipe.

Guide the student to create a simple wire using INJECT and DEBUG nodes.
