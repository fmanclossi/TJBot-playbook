# Examples

This page collects several TJBot activities performed since 2017.

Work with four TJBot already configured as described in [setup pages](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/setup).

## Stage Alternanza Scuola-Lavoro - Segrate, May 2018
[Introduce TJBot and Node-Red Labs](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/examples/Segrate_ASL2018)

## Ideas from Stage Alternanza Scuola-Lavoro - Segrate, May 2018
[Node-Red Labs with TJBot!](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/examples/Segrate_ASL2018_learn_TJBot_with_Node_Red)

## TJBot and his/her dog - When AI meets pets - Segrate, May - October 2018
[Doggy!](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/examples/Doggy)

TJBot loves pets even though they can be noisy. He/Her owns two dogs, Doggy and MiniDoggy.

Doggy is a very careful watchdog while MiniDoggy is more distracted one, it doesn’t look at what happens around it but it’s happy to play with TJBot.

We follow TJBot and its doggies in some funny stories learning how IBM solutions could be applied to real life examples.

Doggy is an original idea from IBM Italy Volunteers. The first draft was developed during a stage with high school students in IBM Italy Segrate, May 2018.

This activity complement [“What’s Possible With AI – TJ Bot” Activity Kit](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/responsibility/initiatives/activitykits/tjbot/)  expanding students’ knowledge regarding robotics , cognitive technologies and AI by helping them build a simple companion for TJBot, a cute dog called Doggy. 

Students will increase experience and skills using a Raspberry Pi, Servo Motors, Sonar sensor and unleash their creativity following TJBot and Doggy in funny tales powered by Watson™ services.

* **Audience:**
** Ages 11-14 (Middle grade students)
