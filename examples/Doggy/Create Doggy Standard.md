# Mount Doggy Standard - a TJBot companion with superdog vision and a cute tail!

Doggy is the perfect companion for your TJBot. DOGGY Standard hosts an HC-SR04 sensor that provides a superdog vision and a servo motor to animate the cutest tail in the world.

# HAVE FUN and REPORT ISSUES!!! PHOTOS, VIDEOS, FEEDBACKS are WELCOME!

## Level: some task could be tricky but could be performed under adult’s guidance

## Requirements

## Get and Print/Copy DOGGY Standard design file

## Mount your Doggy Standard


* Print/reproduce only the Tail and advanced Sheet

![design file to print](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Media/DoggyReduced/01.Doggy%20printed%20sheets%20-%20first.jpg)

* Follow instructions for Doggy Basic, just cut tail parts.

[link to Doggy Basic](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Create%20Doggy%20Basic.md)

* Mount servo motor for tail (do not mount tail now, the right position will to be identified during software setup)

![Basic with servo mounted - and eyes not cut](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Media/DoggyReduced/08.Doggy%20-%20basic%20with%20tail%20servo%20mounted.jpg)

(notice that I forgot to cut eyes)

* wire HC-SR04 sensor and SG-90 servo motor to TJBot (look at the picture to insert servo with the right orientation). A breadboard could make this task easier, but it’s not strictly required.: fix breadboard to Doggy’s back (upside down).
Breadboard wiring for Standard case

8a-Build tail (version #1). Get Servo arm and tape tail to it.

8b-Build tail (version #1). Tail is a personality trait. Use your imagination and try different tails. In the following photo, I wrapped tail starting from servo arm to tail’s end creating a rotation effect that I like.

9 (optional) - print and cut standard belly component from Optional/Advanced Parts design sheet
