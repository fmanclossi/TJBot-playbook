First of all, if you never setup Node-Red environment on TJbot, follow [JCBisson Node-Red nodes for TJBot - setup instructions](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/setup/Setup_Node-Red_on_TJBot.md).

Everything ok? Excellent! You can already follow [other TJBot labs](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/examples) provided in this github space! But... **we want a Doggy**!!!
