Work with TJBot already configured as described in [setup pages](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/setup).

## Setup requirements:

Doggy design is covered by a single project in DXF format.

[Doggy DXF format](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Design_files/Doggy_with_tail_A4_20180905a.dxf)

PDF format is used to split the project to A4 printing and to cover every single configuration.

### BASIC LEVEL

Doggy hosts an HC-SR04 sensor that donates it a superdog vision. Use the folloging files **BUT DO NOT CUT** tail ;)

### MEDIUM AND ADVANCED LEVEL

Doggy has also a tail, powered by one SG-90 servo motor. You can use BASIC LEVEL design files (cutting tail parts) and optionally add a closing part to the bottom. In the advanced scenario, it also has two motorized front legs.
In addition to previous files, download even the following one.

## MINIDOGGY

This little Doggy has just tail, powered by one SG-90 servo motor. No superdog vision!

It's very easy to build 'cause it provided with A4 format. Just print it on your printer and cut, fold, connect.
