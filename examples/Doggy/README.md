It works with TJBot already configured as described in [setup pages](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/setup).

## Doggy's family

### DOGGY BASIC 

Doggy hosts an HC-SR04 sensor that provides a superdog vision.

### DOGGY STANDARD

In addition to BASIC format, Doggy  has also a very cute tail, powered by one SG-90 servo motor.

### DOGGY ADVANCED (PREMIUM)

Doggy increases its capability with two motorized front legs.

## MINIDOGGY

![MiniDoggy](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Media/MiniDoggy_with_tail_20180903b.jpg)

This little Doggy has just tail, powered by one SG-90 servo motor. No superdog vision!

It's very easy to build 'cause it provided with A4 format. Just print it on your printer and cut, fold, connect.

* Doggy Basic - Superdog vision only

Do not use common printer paper. 
Doggy Basic can be easily printed on 200gr/m² A4 paper (local print shop or standard printer) or cardboard.
200gr/m² A4 paper is enough strong to support sensor weight.
No need for "Belly" part (but if you like it, just fold and insert it).

* Doggy Standard - Basic plus ultra-dinamic tail

Do not use common printer paper. 
Doggy Standard can be easily printed on 200gr/m² A4 paper (local print shop or standard printer) or cardboard.
200gr/m² A4 paper is enough strong to support sensor weight.
"Belly" part is optional, depending upon wiring choices (but if you like it, just fold and insert it).

* Doggy Premium - Standard plus powerful front legs

Do not use common printer paper. 
Doggy Standard can be easily printed on 200gr/m² A4 paper (local print shop or standard printer) or cardboard.
200gr/m² A4 paper is enough strong to support sensor weight.
"Belly" part is mandatory. It could be printed on 200gr/m² A4 paper, but cardboard is the best choice.

* MiniDoggy - ultra-dynamic tail only

MiniDoggy can be easily printed on 200gr/m² A4 paper (local print shop or standard printer)
200gr/m² A4 paper is enough strong to support servo motor weight.
No need for "Belly" part (but if you like it, just fold it and insert mounting servo on it). Belly part is mandatory if you use standard printer paper.

 
### Mount your Doggy

#### Doggy Basic - Superdog vision only

* Print/reproduce only the Tail and advanced Sheet

https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Media/DoggyReduced/01.Doggy%20printed%20sheets%20-%20first.jpg

* cut all the red lines using a cutter and a scissor (do not cut parts to host servo motor for tail). If you plan to use superdog vision, remind to cut eyes too.


https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Media/DoggyReduced/01.Doggy%20printed%20sheets%20-%20first%20_%20do%20not%20cut%20tail%20parts.jpg

(P.S: in the following pictures these lines are cut as used in Standard and Advanced version)

* fold up or down green and green lines

(I’m folded up and down)

* stapple left and right ears
      
* stapple neck and back
 
* insert tongue and clip the tail

(notice neck and back staple)

* wire HC-SR04 sensor to TJBot (no need for breadboard)
