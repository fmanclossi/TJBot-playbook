# Tales of two doggies
# TALE 1 ‚Äì Doggy barks and shake its tail if an object is less than 30cm away
Doggy is a very careful watchdog. Nothing and no one can pass without getting a strong barking.

[Back to the previous Scene - Tale1.Scene1 - Create a flow that makes Doggy say ‚ÄúBARK!‚Äù if an object is less than 30cm away](Tale1.Scene1.Say.BARK.md)

## Tale1.Scene2 ‚Äì Make Doggy barking (a real barking!) if an object is less than 30cm away 

**Requirement:** TJBot, Doggy (Basic, Standard or Premium) ‚Äì already setup and tested (https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Setup%20Doggy%20and%20Test%20features.md)

**Skill:** Node-Red (basic level)

**Age:** 8+

**Knowledge acquired:** Sonar sensor usage, test condition, set value to variable, debugging, play audio

**Preparation steps (usually performed by IBMers, Teachers‚Ä¶):**

* point your browser to Node-Red Dashboard - http://¬´TJBot_ip_address¬ª:1880

* verify that TJBot is fully functional and node-red is working as expected (TJBot credentials, too). 

* verify that Tale1.Scene1 is enabled on dedicated Flow

* get a good sound file (WAV format) with a dog barking (e.g. dogbark2.wav from https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/dogs-10026/)

* upload bark sound file to TJBot Desktop using VNC file transfer feature, an USB Key or whatever you like (e.g. /home/pi/Desktop/dogbark2.wav). P.S: You can download it directly using TJBot browser :D

* test TJBot speaker with bark audio file

**Steps:**

* point your browser to Node-Red Dashboard - http://¬´TJBot_ip_address¬ª:1880

* create a new Flow

* double-click Flow label and rename it to ‚ÄúTale1.Scene2‚Äù. Press ‚ÄúDone‚Äù to close.

* double-click ‚ÄúTale1.Scene1‚Äù Flow label and set status to ‚ÄúDisabled‚Äù. Press ‚ÄúDone‚Äù to close.

* select all nodes in ‚ÄúTale1.Scene1‚Äù Flow drawing an area over them

* press CTRL+C keys to copy.

* click on ‚ÄúTale1.Scene2‚Äù Flow label

* press CTRL+V keys to paste nodes. When you find the best place to paste them, right click to save positions.

* delete DEBUG node (click on it and press DEL key)

* drag SPEAK node (from TJBot palette) to the Working area

![image]( https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Media/Tales/t01s23.Add.TJBOT.SPEAK.Node.jpg)

* double-click SPEAK node, select BOT according to your environment, set MODE to ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù and set NAME to ‚ÄúBark‚Äù

![image]( https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Media/Tales/t01s24.Configure.TJBOT.SPEAK.Node.jpg)

* connect it to CHANGE node and press DEPLOY button

Do you get a strong barking when you put an object near to Doggy‚Äôs eyes? If not, very prerequisites (e.g. audio power turned on üòä )

What happen if the object stays near Doggy?

**Congratulation! You‚Äôre ready to move to the next level! Let‚Äôs make Doggy a little smarter!**
