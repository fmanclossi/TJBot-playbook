# Tales of two doggies

TJBot loves pets even they could be noisy.

He/Her owns two dogs, Doggy and MiniDoggy.

Doggy is a very careful watchdog. Nothing and no one can pass without getting a strong barking.

Mini Doggy is more distracted one, it doesn’t look at what happens around it but it’s happy to play with TJBot.

In the following scenarios, we follow TJBot and its doggies in some funny stories learning how IBM solutions could be applied to real life examples.

Every tale includes Doggy requirement, Skills, Age, Knowledge acquired and preparaton steps.

## TALE 1 – Doggy barks and shake its tail if an object is less than 30cm away

We already known that Doggy is a very careful watchdog. Nothing and no one can pass without getting a strong barking and a cute tail shaking.

Funny? I **challenge you** to mix scene3 and scene4 elements to make Doggy barking and shaking tail when an object is near than 30cm. Ready… Steady… GO!

**Fantastic! Doggy is growing up smarter, step by step!**

Let's now introduce TJBot in our story. He/She knows that Doggy barks to everything. But it's cute and he/she loves it.

## TALE 2 – Doggy is a greedy pet and needs to go on diet

Doggy is a cute pet... sweet tooth, too. Cake, ice creams but also hamburgers, chips, pizza and pasta! It needs to go on diet and start doing exercises!

![image](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Media/Tales/t02c01.Doggy.Lazy.PushUps.Animated.gif)

* [Tale2.Scene1 - Stand Up, Doggy](Tale1.Scene5.StandUp.Doggy.md) - Doggy stands up on its front legs when anything is less that 30cm away

* [Tale2.Scene2 – Doggy, trying to do push-ups](Tale2.Scene2.Doggy.Push-ups.md) - Doggy does push-ups when anything is less that 30cm away

**Challenge time!** Doggy doesn't like to do exercises. When it start a serie, if nothing is near to it, it moves its tail instead of doing push-ups. Modify previous scene to introduce this behavior.

* [Tale2.Scene3 – TJBot helps Doggy doing exercises](Tale2.Scene3.TJBot.Helps.Doggy.Push-ups.md) - When anything is less that 30cm away, TJBot start counting push-ups for Doggy

**Challenge time:** Now, leverage on TJBot capabilities. TJBot thinks that could be useful to move his/her arm while Doggy do push-ups and to light up led to advice that a new serie is started. Are you able to modify the flow to compelte this task?
