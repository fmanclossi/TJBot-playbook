# Tales of two doggies

TJBot loves pets even they could be noisy.

He/Her owns two dogs, Doggy and MiniDoggy.

Doggy is a very careful watchdog. Nothing and no one can pass without getting a strong barking.

Mini Doggy is more distracted one, it doesn’t look at what happens around it but it’s happy to play with TJBot.

In the following scenarios, we follow TJBot and its doggies in some funny stories learning how IBM solutions could be applied to real life examples.

Every tale includes Doggy requirement, Skills, Age, Knowledge acquired and preparaton steps.

## TALE 1 – Doggy barks and shake its tail if an object is less than 30cm away

We already known that Doggy is a very careful watchdog. Nothing and no one can pass without getting a strong barking and a cute tail shaking.

* [Tale1.Scene1 - Create a flow that makes Doggy say “BARK!” if an object is less than 30cm away](Tale1.Scene1.Say.BARK.md)

* [Tale1.Scene2 – Make Doggy barking (a real barking!) if an object is less than 30cm away](Tale1.Scene2.BARKING.md)

* [Tale1.Scene3 – Smart barking, just one time, please!](Tale1.Scene3.Smart.BARKING.md)

* [Tale1.Scene4 – Shake a tail! Shake it, shake it, shake it Doggy!](Tale1.Scene4.Shake.Tail.md)

Funny? I **challenge you** to mix scene3 and scene4 elements to make Doggy barking and shaking tail when an object is near than 30cm. Ready… Steady… GO!

**Fantastic! Doggy is growing up smarter, step by step!**
It’s time to introduce TJBot in our tale!

### Extra scenes

* [Tale1.Scene5 - Stand Up, Doggy](Tale1.Scene5.StandUp.Doggy.md) - Doggy stands up on its front legs when anything is less that 30cm away

**Challenge time!** Are you able to change how Doggy react to object? When no object is close to Doggy, it stand up watching for enemy 😊 When object is less than 30cm away, it goes on its belly and shake its tale.
