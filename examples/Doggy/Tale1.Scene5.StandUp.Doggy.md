## Tale1.Scene5 – Stand Up, Doggy!

**Requirement:** TJBot, Doggy Premium – [already setup and tested](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/blob/master/examples/Doggy/Setup%20Doggy%20and%20Test%20features.md)

**Skill:** Node-Red (basic level)

**Age:** 8+

**Knowledge acquired:** Servo motor and Sonar sensor usage, test condition, set value to variable

**Preparation steps (usually performed by IBMers, Teachers…):**

* point your browser to Node-Red Dashboard - http://«TJBot_ip_address»:1880

* verify that TJBot is fully functional and node-red is working as expected (TJBot credentials, too).

* (Doggy version only) verify that Tale1.Scene4 is enabled and working on dedicated Flow

**Steps:**

* point your browser to Node-Red Dashboard - http://«TJBot_ip_address»:1880

* create a new Flow

What happen when an obstacle reaches Doggy?

What happen if the object stays away from Doggy?

What happen if the object stays in front of Doggy’s eyes?

**Challenge time!** Are you able to change how Doggy react to object? When no object is close to Doggy, it stand up watching for enemy 😊 When object is less than 30cm away, it goes on its belly and shake its tale.

**Anyone scared by Doggy? Don't panic! It's a cute dog.**
