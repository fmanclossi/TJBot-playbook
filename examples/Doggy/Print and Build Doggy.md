# Print (or Copy) and Build Doggy

Doggy is available in four format, expanding TJBot features and enabling funny scenarios.

It works with TJBot already configured as described in [setup pages](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/setup).

## Doggy's family

* DOGGY BASIC - Doggy hosts an HC-SR04 sensor that provides a superdog vision.

* DOGGY STANDARD - In addition to BASIC format, Doggy  has also a very cute tail, powered by one SG-90 servo motor.

* DOGGY ADVANCED (PREMIUM) - Doggy increases its capability with two motorized front legs.

* MINIDOGGY - This little Doggy has just tail, powered by one SG-90 servo motor. No superdog vision!
