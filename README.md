I've collected a presentation about TJBot to support activities performed at I.I.S. Galileo Galilei di Crema (CR), a secondary state school with about 1,900 students aged 14-19 working in two fields of education: “Applied Sciences high school” and “Technological high school”.

[This is the last version](ASL%20-%20TJBot%20playground%20v0.5.20180618.pptx)

This is an *early* way to share it.

I'm starting collecting and sharing student's guide and proposed exercises. Feel free to collaborate.

# Setup

For many of the proposed LABs you can use a standard TJBot or a modified one. If a different configuration is required, it will be noted at the start of the exercise.
Many exercises are based upon Node-Red. It's easy to learn and to explain, and good for every kind of students (from kids to grandmas)!
