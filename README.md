I've collected a presentation about TJBot to support activities performed at I.I.S. Galileo Galilei di Crema (CR), a secondary state school with about 1,900 students aged 14-19 working in two fields of education: “Applied Sciences high school” and “Technological high school”.

[This is the last version](ASL%20-%20TJBot%20playground%20v0.5.20180618.pptx)

This is an *early* way to share it.

I'm starting collecting and sharing student's guide and proposed exercises. Feel free to collaborate.

# Setup

For many of the proposed LABs you can use a standard TJBot or a modified one. If a different configuration is required, it will be noted at the start of the exercise.
Many exercises are based upon Node-Red. It's easy to learn and to explain, and good for every kind of students (from kids to grandmas)!

# Let's Play

## JeanCarl Node-Red examples
JeanCarl Bisson, an IBM Developer Advocate. ![JeanCarlBisson](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/60/60/1*tocg1dafjcMwYIKG8wnpww.jpeg) created a wonderful [Medium series on Node-Red and TJBot](https://medium.com/@jeancarlbisson/how-to-train-your-tjbot-in-node-red-88bfb3bbe0ab) where he explains how to setup and use his Node-Red nodes with YouTube videos and ready-to-use code.

You can reach him on [Github node-red-contrib-tjbot Repository](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-contrib-tjbot).

...work in progress...

[TJBot and his/her dog!](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/examples/Doggy)

TJBot loves pets even they could be noisy. He/Her owns two dogs, Doggy and MiniDoggy. Doggy is a very careful watchdog. Nothing and no one can pass without getting a strong barking. Mini Doggy is more distracted one, it doesn’t look at what happens around it but it’s happy to play with TJBot.

We follow TJBot and its doggies in some funny stories learning how IBM solutions could be applied to real life examples.

Every tale includes Doggy requirement, Skills, Age, Knowledge acquired and preparaton steps.
