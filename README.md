I've collected a presentation about TJBot to support activities performed at I.I.S. Galileo Galilei di Crema (CR), a secondary state school with about 1,900 students aged 14-19 working in two fields of education: “Applied Sciences high school” and “Technological high school”.

[This is the last version](ASL%20-%20TJBot%20playground%20v0.5.20180618.pptx)

This is an *early* way to share it.

I hope to find time to colelct and share student's guide and proposed exercises.
