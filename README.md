# TJBot-playbook
Collected information about IBM TJBot, most from all the fans around the world!

Contribution are welcome!

First of all, read https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot
Many thanks to the entire TJBot team!!!

Second, free your creativity!

I've collected a presentation about TJBot to support activities performed at I.I.S. Galileo Galilei di Crema (CR), a secondary state school with about 1,900 students aged 14-19 working in two fields of education: “Applied Sciences high school” and “Technological high school”.

[This is the last version](ASL%20-%20TJBot%20playground%20v0.5.20180618.pptx)

This is an *early* way to share it.

I'm starting collecting and sharing student's guide and proposed exercises. Feel free to collaborate.

# Setup

For many of the proposed LABs you can use a standard TJBot or a modified one. If a different configuration is required, it will be noted at the start of the exercise.
Many exercises are based upon Node-Red. It's easy to learn and to explain, and good for every kind of students (from kids to grandmas)!

# Let's Play

## JeanCarl Node-Red examples
JeanCarl Bisson, an IBM Developer Advocate. ![JeanCarlBisson](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/60/60/1*tocg1dafjcMwYIKG8wnpww.jpeg) created a wonderful [Medium series on Node-Red and TJBot](https://medium.com/@jeancarlbisson/how-to-train-your-tjbot-in-node-red-88bfb3bbe0ab) where he explains how to setup and use his Node-Red nodes with YouTube videos and ready-to-use code.

You can reach him on [Github node-red-contrib-tjbot Repository](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-contrib-tjbot).

## Segrate Alternanza Scuola Lavoro May 2018
### [Node-Red Labs with TJBot!](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/examples/Segrate_ASL2018)

...work in progress...

## [TJBot and his/her dog - When AI meets pets - Segrate, May - October 2018](https://github.com/fmanclossi/TJBot-playbook/tree/master/examples/Doggy)

TJBot loves pets even though they can be noisy. He/Her owns two dogs, Doggy and MiniDoggy.

Doggy is a very careful watchdog while MiniDoggy is more distracted one, it doesn’t look at what happens around it but it’s happy to play with TJBot.

We follow TJBot and its doggies in some funny stories learning how IBM solutions could be applied to real life examples.

Doggy is an original idea from IBM Italy Volunteers. The first draft was developed during a stage with high school students in IBM Italy Segrate, May 2018.

This activity complement [“What’s Possible With AI – TJ Bot” Activity Kit](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/responsibility/initiatives/activitykits/tjbot/)  expanding students’ knowledge regarding robotics , cognitive technologies and AI by helping them build a simple companion for TJBot, a cute dog called Doggy. 

Students will increase experience and skills using a Raspberry Pi, Servo Motors, Sonar sensor and unleash their creativity following TJBot and Doggy in funny tales powered by Watson™ services.

* **Audience:**
  * Ages 11-14 (Middle grade students)
  * Ages 14-19 (Secondary/high school students) 
* **What’s the goal of this kit?**
  * Introduce cognitive technologies and programming
  * Explore “embedded cognition”— everyday objects that use AI to interact with us
  * Support environmental education activity reusing cardboard and common material
* **Why is this topic important?**
  * The technologies introduced through this activity have a growing impact in our world.
  * A fun, creative, hands-on project is an ideal way to stimulate students’ interest in STEM topics
