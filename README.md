I've collected a presentation about TJBot to support activities performed at I.I.S. Galileo Galilei di Crema (CR), a secondary state school with about 1,900 students aged 14-19 working in two fields of education: “Applied Sciences high school” and “Technological high school”.

[This is the last version](ASL%20-%20TJBot%20playground%20v0.5.20180618.pptx)

This is an *early* way to share it.

I'm starting collecting and sharing student's guide and proposed exercises. Feel free to collaborate.

# Setup

For many of the proposed LABs you can use a standard TJBot or a modified one. If a different configuration is required, it will be noted at the start of the exercise.
Many exercises are based upon Node-Red. It's easy to learn and to explain, and good for every kind of students (from kids to grandmas)!

# Let's Play

## JeanCarl Node-Red examples
JeanCarl Bisson, an IBM Developer Advocate. ![JeanCarlBisson](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/60/60/1*tocg1dafjcMwYIKG8wnpww.jpeg) created a wonderful [Medium series on Node-Red and TJBot](https://medium.com/@jeancarlbisson/how-to-train-your-tjbot-in-node-red-88bfb3bbe0ab) where he explains how to setup and use his Node-Red nodes with YouTube videos and ready-to-use code.

You can reach him on [Github node-red-contrib-tjbot Repository](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-contrib-tjbot).
